# Zondarr

Zondarr is a unified invitation and user management system for media servers (Plex, Jellyfin). It enables server administrators to:

- Generate secure, time-limited invitation codes for user onboarding
- Configure permissions, library access, and expiration policies per invitation
- Manage users across multiple media servers from a single interface
- Track invitation usage and user lifecycle
- Create optional wizard flows (pre/post-invite) with configurable interaction steps

The system consists of a Litestar API backend and a SvelteKit frontend, designed for self-hosted deployment.
