"""MediaClient protocol definition.

Provides the Protocol-based abstraction for media server clients.
Uses Python's typing.Protocol for structural subtyping - implementations
do not need to inherit from this class, they just need to implement
the required methods.

The protocol defines:
- Connection lifecycle via async context manager
- Server connectivity testing
- Library retrieval
- User management (create, delete, enable/disable)
- Library access configuration
- Capability declaration

Uses Python 3.14 features:
- Deferred annotations (no forward reference quotes needed)
- Self type for proper return type in subclasses
- Positional-only and keyword-only parameters where appropriate

class MediaClient(Protocol):
    """Protocol defining the interface for media server clients.

    Implementations must support async context manager for connection lifecycle.
    Uses Python 3.14 deferred annotations - no forward reference quotes needed.
    Uses Self type for proper return type in subclasses.

    All methods are async to support non-blocking I/O operations.
    For sync libraries (like python-plexapi), implementations should use
    asyncio.to_thread() to avoid blocking the event loop.

    Example usage:
        async with client as c:
            if await c.test_connection():
                libraries = await c.get_libraries()
