"""Wizard, WizardStep, and StepInteraction models for configurable onboarding flows.

Provides:
- InteractionType: StrEnum for supported wizard step interaction types
- Wizard: Model representing a configurable wizard flow
- WizardStep: Model representing a single step within a wizard
- StepInteraction: Model representing an interaction attached to a step

Uses SQLAlchemy 2.0 patterns with mapped_column and Mapped types.
Relationships use cascade delete for steps when wizard is deleted,
and for interactions when step is deleted.
