"""MediaServer and Library models for media server management.

Provides:
- MediaServer: Model representing a media server instance
- Library: Model representing a content library within a media server

Uses SQLAlchemy 2.0 patterns with mapped_column and Mapped types.
Relationships use selectinload for collections and joined for single relations
to avoid N+1 query issues in async contexts.
